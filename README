This library is developed mainly with support for Dune 2 data to use by the
Doon Lunacy (http://launchpad.net/doonlunacy) project in mind.
The library is none the less written in a generic manner to make it flexible
and useful enough for others as well, providing SDL classes, python bindings
& a command line tool based on the bindings to handle these data formats.

The library currently supports the following:
* Archiving:
** reading and writing of PAK format
* Graphics:
** reading of ICN + MAP format
** reading of CPS format 
** reading of SHP format (for both formats used by Dune 2 demo & other versions)
** reading of WSA format (for both formats used by Dune 2 demo & other versions
   and also (untested) WSA 2 format used by later Westwood games)
** reading and writing of PAL palette format
** writing to BMP format
** pixel art scaling using scale2x, scale2x3, scale2x4, scale3x & scale4x algorithms
* Audio:
** reading of VOC format
** reading of ADL format (XMI, C55 & PCS in the works...)
** several different OPL emulators, hardware OPL & disk writer plugin for midi playback
** writing to WAV format
** sample rate conversion using Secret Rabbit Code (aka libsamplerate)
* Other:
** reading of text string format used by Dune 2 (ie. CREDITS.ENG, TEXT.ENG etc.)
** assembly & disassembly of EMC "script" format
** reading of FNT format for font rendering
** reading of DOS MZ format & various data structures used in DUNE2.EXE
** reading and writing of Dune 2 INI format

Full support for encoding to most of these formats is either planned or already
in progress. Some of the formats also still lacks classes in the python
bindings implementing the C++ library, but most will eventually be provided
in the bindings where feasible...

Support for data formats used by other Westwood games such as ie. C&C is
planned, while support for other non-Westwood formats is fully possible
if code and/or resources for implementing is provided.
If you'd like to help out working on this or any other details you'd have
interest in, I encourage you in creating your own branches @
http://launchpad.net/libeastwood and proposing your code for merging,
this is the definitely best way of contributing to and participating in this
project, but patches on their own are always cheerfully accepted as well! :)

Greetings and great thanks to everyone at the Dune Editings forums @
http://forum.dune2k.com for providing great information and constantly helping
out reverse engineer these! :o)
